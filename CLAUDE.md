# King of 20

## Cleanup Rules
- After moving or refactoring code, delete any files/components that are no longer used
- Remove unused imports
- Don't leave orphaned files behind

## Style Preferences
- Avoid box-shadow by default. It can be used when it clearly enhances the design, but should not be the go-to choice.
